        <p> Bonjour! I am Gabriella Mujinga Ilunga. I am originally from Mbuji-Mayi in DR Congo,but
            I am currently based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am studying Software Development
            with BYU-Pathway, and honestly, I just love learning new things,whether I am getting
            lost in a good book, catching a football match, or figuring out my first few lines of
            code. Right now, I am focused on building my skills and seeing what the tech world has
            to offer so I can figure out exactly where I want to specialize. This website is my
            first real project as I learn to build things from scratch, and I am really excited to
            see where this journey goes from here..
